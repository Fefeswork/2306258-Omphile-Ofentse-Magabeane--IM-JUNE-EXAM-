          <h2>Blog 1: The medium is the message</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            McLuhan in a way foreshadowed the evolution of media in a way,
            considering there was little to no technology during his time, and
            content was spread through writing and not so much technology. It
            makes me wonder if people did know that technology would advance
            over time. After investigating to comparison McLuhan makes between a
            lightbulb and medium, I then started thinking about being stranded
            on an island. As seen on tv the sand on the beach seems useless
            unless you start writing some content that is your message which is
            then read and understood by someone who will eventually rescue you.
            One line did stand out to me while reading this: “For the “message”
            of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or
            pattern that it introduces into human affairs.” This line, in
            particular, stood out to me because I immediately thought of what a
            big influence social media has on society today. A lot of messages
            are shared through social media, an example is learning a new
            skincare tip from a social media influencer or learning a cheat code
            for a level you couldn’t beat in a game from a streamer. Social
            media has also been the instigator for bad messages, these bad
            messages being display fake standard beauty standards which leads to
            people being self-conscious about themselves. Upon learning more
            about media- what McLuhan means by the medium is the message; that
            different media is perceived in different ways, essentially people
            interact with mediums differently. For example, reading a book is
            completely different from playing a game or watching a movie. The
            information I’m receiving from the one medium may mean something
            different on another medium even if the message is the same.

          <h2>Blog 2: Semantic Markup- what is it and why is it necessary</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            What is Sematic markup?
            <br />
            Semantic markup refers to how you structure and write your code with
            regards to HTML, we can also look at is as the layout of the
            website. It also entails as to why certain structures and formats
            work better than others in terms of writing quality code. How I
            understand this is simple thinking of it as layers within layers: an
            example I will use is a sports team, in sports teams we have
            different ranks that help the entire team function: we have the team
            managers which manage the team and ensure that everything is running
            smoothly. Underneath the managers we have the coaches: strength and
            conditioning coach, assistant coach, and the head coach. Although
            they all fall under the category of coach, they each have a specific
            part of the team they run which distributes the role evenly. Then
            finally we have the players which are being managed by the coaches
            and the managers. Without the coaches nand managers there would be
            no team and without the players there wouldn’t be a team to coach.
            This analogy links nicely with the concept of semantic markup, as we
            can think of it in that way.
            <br />
            In the reading Lawson writes : “So a homepage with a list of blog
            posts would be a ‘main’ element wrapping a series of ‘article’
            elements, one for each blog post”(Lawson,2022). In this line he is
            describing how a ‘main’ consists of ‘articles’ with in the
            container. In my own work I had not really considered sematic markup
            until we looked into it and why it is a thing in web development.
            After learning about this and applying my sports team analogy it has
            helped me structure my code better to structure my website better
            Semantic markup is necessary because it helps developers write clear
            code, it provides a better site structure, it also plays a role in
            how your overall website performs as well as it improves the quality
            of accessibility to the developers’ site.<br />

          <h2>Blog 3: information Greography</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            The topic of information geography refers to the use of technology
            around the world. So, in this instance, the topic is referring to
            how many people have access to the internet. This information takes
            into consideration the sizes of the countries as well. As it is
            known countries in the Northern hemisphere will have a larger number
            of people using the internet compares to the population located in
            the southern hemisphere. The article takes note of how the high
            prices that are placed on internet sources and how that lead to
            inaccessibility of the internet thus hindering the access and growth
            of internet sources in the southern hemisphere. The article also
            looks into geographies of participation, which measures
            participation in digital activities. The article uses GitHub as an
            example as it is a large platform that many people around the world
            use to share source code and publish their own code for other sot
            use. This example further shows that the North has more users and
            more commits than the south did.<br />

          <h2>Blog 4: The importance of Accessibilty</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            What is accessibility? <br />Accessibility can be seen as how
            “accessible” a product is. In terms of design, it can refer to how
            usable is your product. When designing a product especially in the
            digital space. It is very import to take into account the
            accessibility aspect of you works. Accessibility focuses on
            equipping people with disabilities access to reliable and assertive
            technology so that they can also benefit from the advantages of
            using technology.<br />
            Why is this important?<br />
            As mentioned above it is to consider people with disabilities. We
            know that there are three types of accessibilities we as designers
            need to consider these being: motor, auditory and visual. In the
            digital space we try to consider all three, we also look for new
            methods to present digital work and new way to make it accessible.
            <br />What I know about Accessibility:<br />
            During my general studies outside of interactive media, I’ve learned
            how to incorporate accessibility in my work. I’ve most worked on
            accessibility for Visual disabilities such as red-green colour
            blindness and dyslexia. When designing colour palettes, I avoid
            using red, green and in some cases blues. I opt for softer and easy
            on the eye colours such as your greys, light pinks, whites, and
            blacks. I am also careful with the fonts I choose; I avoid flashy
            and fancy fonts as most of the time people cannot differentiate the
            letter make it hard to read what the developer is trying to
            communicate to the user. From doing research I now understand that
            the font that I use a lot ‘times new roman’ isn’t necessarily
            accessible, I can see why because it does have a few letters which
            are hard to differentiate at times. I should look at more neutral
            fonts like Helvica and Lucia as those font are considered
            accessible.

          <h2>Blog 5:Internet, Society and Design Justice</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            This week I chose to look into The Marginalised and Technology
            because it is a topic that is interesting to talk about and also
            because I fall under the one marginalized groups- a black female
            that happens to be pursuing a career in the digital space. We begin
            by acknowledging that the world of technology does not focus on
            marginalized groups and that it is a white male-dominated domain. In
            the society we are living in technology is a fast-growing phenomenon
            in which many people around the world own at least one device. This
            means that more people are entering the technological space and room
            needs to be made to cater to everyone. “The first move toward
            Relational ethics is an acknowledgment that when we are dealing with
            data (especially those that measure, classify, and/or analyse the
            social, cultural, and political realm), Preprint. Under review. we
            are necessarily dealing with human culture, values, and meaning.”
            (Birhane and Cummins,2019) What this means is that this is how it
            begins. It begins with classification, once these classifications
            were made it is hard for society to move away from these
            classifications as it has become standard thing. A reading by
            Liverpool E. Onyije and Briggs Francis explores technological
            solutions for the marginalized. They explore how ICTs(Information
            and communication technology) have been proved to be effective in
            empowering the youth as well as women. These ICTs enable recipients
            the ability to formulate strategies that address the issues at hand.
            These ICTs also “specialize in creating policies and strategies for
            enabling gender empowerment.” (Onyije and Francis,2012). We are
            learning that ICTs are become something that is used to assist
            marginalized groups. by means of providing access to relevant
            information, trainings, skills development and livelihood generation
            opportunities. <br />

          <h2>Blog 6: Refelction on UX/UI</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            Reflection on UI and UX What is user interface:<br />
            <br />
            I think I’ve done a decent job with regards to my UI and UX, I give
            the user an easy and clear structure of how the website functions. I
            do however, think I could expand more on this and consider this more
            as I feel like I was rather designing the webpage for me and not
            necessarily the user. An example of this would be when I was
            designing the a wireframes and the aesthetic of the website: I did
            consider the user to a certain extent but landed up giving in to
            what looked and felt nice for me. the good: I think what I’ve been
            able to do well is consider the accessibility of the website as a
            wholesale I made sure to choose colour schemes that catered to
            people who may be colour blindness. With the fonts I managed to
            choose fonts that were easy to read to cater to people who may not
            be cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia. My wireframes an east to
            navigate and aren’t to be overwhelming to the user. The bad: The
            overall responsiveness of the design isn’t quite polished yet, only
            certain elements respond well to the change in size such as the
            headers and images, however, the text on each page does not adjust
            accordingly which messes with the design. I could’ve applied my
            theory work a little more in terms of my design and offering users a
            better experience. The aesthetic doesn’t necessarily match what the
            content of my website: I focused on making it pretty instead of
            making use of the aesthetic to convey the message.

            Reflecting back on the work I have done this semester I have learned
            a lot as a web developer, and I still have a lot to learn. I have
            managed to grasp a lot of concepts with ease and other are still a
            bit hard to grasp but with practice I think I’ll become better in
            those aspects. Looking at my work. I think I’ve done a decent job in
            creating this website, I’ve managed to apply the theory I’ve learned
            throughout the semester: I believe I’ve improved in terms of writing
            quality code and making use of semantic markup to write clear code.
            I’ve also managed to take the critical feedback I’ve received by my
            peers and apply it the work. In terms of creativity, I think I’ve
            grown as a designer, I’ve learned not to design for aesthetics only
            but through my choice of design I should communicate a message too.
            With the first two assignments I did not take that into account and
            ended up designing according to what will good, but now I’ve been
            able to communicate what my website entails through the images and
            information I’ve chosen to display.
            <br />
            In terms of accessibility- I think my website is fairly accessible.
            I made decisions based of feedback I’ve received from people with
            the disabilities( a few family members and friends) I was catering
            for. I reflect this in my style guide where I explain why I’ve made
            the design decisions I’ve made. I have also decided to work with
            very basic wireframe designs that are known by many people because a
            product is often well received when it is something new but with a
            sense of familiarity.
            <br />
            Reflecting on my strengths and weaknesses this semester, I’ve
            realised that I haven’t been able to grasp JavaScript as much as I
            would have liked to. This is also seen in my work- there’s very
            minimal JavaScript being used due to my lack of confidence to
            incorporate it in my work. My strengths have been working with CSS
            as well as HTML- I feel like those are my strongest programming
            languages that I have used this semester. This is seen through the
            coding scripts I’ve written with some assistance from documentation.
            I use a lot of comments to show that I understand what each line of
            code is doing in the document.
            <br />
            Overall, I believe that I still have a lot to learn as a web
            developer in terms of learning efficient ways to improve on my
            programming skills.

          <h2>Blog 8: JavaScript Dependecies Essay</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O</h3>
          <p>
            The JavaScript dependency I have chosen is the jQuery image
            slide/slideshow. I have implemented this in my portfolio page as
            well as my Styleguide page on my website. The reason why I chose to
            make/ use an image slider was to optimize the space that was being
            used on the page, for creative design reasons I wanted to showcase
            my style guide as a ‘book-like page that displays all my design
            ideas and choices and for the portfolio I wanted to showcase
            screenshots from porotypes I have made during my studies. This
            JavaScript dependency has also worked well in terms of responding
            well to changes being made with screen resizing.
            <br />
            According to an article by 1WD Article, the jQuery image slide
            (slide JS) is considered to be part of the Top 50 jQuery galleries
            in 2020. The article further describes the slide JS as “responsive,
            has touch support, easy setup, and CSS3 transitions.” ( 1WD
            editorial team, 2020). This is true as I have seen advantages that
            have come with using the slide JS these being: it’s easy to use,
            there is a lot of documentation and good tutorials available to me
            and it has a large library meaning I can play around with how I
            would like the slide to be displayed.
            <br />
            Although the slide JS presents itself with many advantages it also
            came with many technical challenges, as per the JScripters.com
            article states that one of the disadvantages of the slide JS is that
            the “functionality is limited”, which is something I discovered when
            I had to make multiple image slider for one page. The JavaScript
            would only allow me to add two image sliders per page which forced
            me to create more pages to display my work.
            <br />
            This dependency was suitable for my site and creative intentions
            because as mentioned previously my goal was to optimize the space of
            the page, having multiple images on one-page scrolling down can get
            tedious and does not look great design-wise. Having the image slider
            allowed me to have multiple images in a controlled space without it
            being too overwhelming.
            <br />
            The alternatives to a slideshow/image slider were stand-alone images
            and image grids. The image grids would have been a good choice
            however they would not read well: the user would automatically see
            everything and not necessarily know what going on as there are
            different images in different grids whereas with the image slider
            the user can look at each image at a time and process it before
            moving on to the next one. According to the 6 Design Alternatives to
            Avoid Slideshows article by media current, slideshows are always the
            best design choice because they have “poor accessibility and are
            distracting” (MEDIACURRENT TEAM, 2017). I do partially disagree with
            this article as the scenario I have used them in allows room for
            accessibility and it does not distract the user as they can focus on
            one thing at a time.<br />
